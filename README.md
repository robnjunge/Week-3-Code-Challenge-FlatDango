## Project Description
For this challenge, you will be working on FlataDango, an app where you can see the movies that are available and you can also buy the tickets to watch the movies shown. You will use a local API and build out the frontend for our app, FlataDango.

## Installation

* VS Code
* json-server
* node

## Running User Application
Clone from this here: 

* Run this command


```sh
json-server --watch db.json
```

Test your server by visiting this route in the browser:

[http://localhost:3000/films](http://localhost:3000/films)

Then, open the `index.html` file on your browser to run the application.

Write your code in the `src/index.js` file. The base URL for your API will be
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
